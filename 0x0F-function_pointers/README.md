C - Function pointers
TASKS
0. What's my name
Write a function that prints a name.
1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done
Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities
Write a function that searches for an integer.
3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at
Write a program that performs simple operations.

You are allowed to use the standard library

Usage: calc num1 operator num2

You can assume num1 and num2 are integers, so use the atoi function to convert them from the string input to int

operator is one of the following:

+: addition
-: subtraction
*: multiplication
/: division
%: modulo
The program prints the result of the operation, followed by a new line

You can assume that the result of all operations can be stored in an int

if the number of arguments is wrong, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 98

if the operator is none of the above, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 99

if the user tries to divide (/ or %) by 0, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 100

This task requires that you create four different files.

3-calc.h
This file should contain all the function prototypes and data structures used by the program. You can use this structure:
3-op_functions.c
This file should contain the 5 following functions (not more):

op_add: returns the sum of a and b. Prototype: int op_add(int a, int b);
op_sub: returns the difference of a and b. Prototype: int op_sub(int a, int b);
op_mul: returns the product of a and b. Prototype: int op_mul(int a, int b);
op_div: returns the result of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_div(int a, int b);
op_mod: returns the remainder of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_mod(int a, int b);
3-get_op_func.c
This file should contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user. Youâ€™re not allowed to declare any other function.
4. Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker
Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.

Usage: ./main number_of_bytes

Output format:

the opcodes should be printed in hexadecimal, lowercase
each opcode is two char long
listing ends with a new line
see example
You are allowed to use printf and atoi

You have to use atoi to convert the argument to an int

If the number of argument is not the correct one, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1

If the number of bytes is negative, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 2

You do not have to compile with any flags
